# Entry point for the client container in the E2E test.
#
# Brings up the tunnel client and then verifies real connectivity *through* the
# encrypted tunnel by pinging the server's in-tunnel address (10.9.0.1). A
# successful ping proves the full data path end to end:
#
#   client kernel -> TUN -> Endpoint::send -> obfs(salt ++ AEAD) -> UDP -> server
#   -> Endpoint::recv -> server TUN -> server kernel replies -> server TUN
#   -> Endpoint::send -> UDP -> client -> Endpoint::recv -> TUN -> echo reply.
#
# The client sends first (the ping), which is also how the server learns the
# client's UDP address. The script exits 0 on success and non-zero on failure,
# so the compose run can use `--exit-code-from client` as the test's verdict.
